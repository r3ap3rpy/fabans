### Welcome

This repository is free to use and allows you to learn how you can utilize [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) and [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
Fabric alone only lets you automate devices which are reachable via *linux*.
Ansible can do both *linux* and *windows* devices.

The course can be found on *udemy* and *skillshare*.

Most of the videos come with markdown based guides aswell.
