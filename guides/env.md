### Environment

The hardware layout looks like this.

[!layout](/pics/layout.png)

For the virtual machines I use [VMware Workstation 15](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html), for the *route* I use [GNS3](https://gns3.com/software/download-vm).

From user perspective the username used on all devices is *fabric* with the password *fabric*, yes the ansible is configured to use the fabric username.

In the videos I show you everything except the installation of the operating systems.

The host machine is a [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/hu-hu/software-download/windows10) laptop with [Python3.7 x64](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) installed.
