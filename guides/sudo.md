### Sudo privileges

This guide covers 3 scripts.

- sudo_1.py
- sudo_2.py
- sudo_3.py

The first script bleeds because it assumes that you have passwordless sudo acces which is shown hot to be configured in the video.

The second script shows you how to create a *responder* which is able to fill in the sudo password for you.

The third script uses the built-in functionaliy of the module to figure out when sudo password needs to be entered.
